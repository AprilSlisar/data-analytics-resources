# Technical Resources

The following resources include everything technical about learning data analytics. From course platforms and specific courses to where you can practice your coding skills or host your portfolio.

## Course Platforms

Websites where you can find specific courses on tools like SQL or Python. Some platforms go into more detail about the soft skills and how to break into tech as well.

- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) - has many courses on a variety of topics, it has popular courses for data analytics like the [Google Course](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) or the [IBM course](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst). Along with specific courses for skills. There's a free option and a [subscription based option](https://www.coursera.org/courseraplus) which is $59/month.
- [Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/) - they have everything from [specific courses](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/online-data-analysis-courses) to learn skills to a [Bootcamp](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-analyst-bootcamp) and learning paths for different types of careers. Check out the "Learn" tab on their site for specifics. It is a [subscription based service](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/signup/pricing) for $39/month.
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) - basic introduction to various skills and it's completely free
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) - has all types of courses that if you get them on sale they cost usually ($15-$25). I used this for learning specific skills like SQL or Pytho.
- [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) - an all encompassing platform to learn common skills in data analytics. They have [specific courses](https://www.datacamp.com/courses-all) to "learning tracks" for jobs like Data Analyst or Data Scientist. The platform has a free version (first chapter of every course and select courses) and a [paid version](https://www.datacamp.com/pricing) which is $25/month.
- [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - this is tailored towards people interested in coding. It has a variety of coding languages but it does include courses on Python and SQL. There's a free version and a paid version which is [subscription based](https://www.codecademy.com/pricing). The pro version is $25/month.
- [Analyst Builder](https://www.analystbuilder.com/) - an all-in-one platform to become a data analyst. It has online courses, crash courses, and practice SQL questions for interviews.

### Specific Courses

Below are some specific courses I've taken and have personally used.

- [Data Analyst Bootcamp (Free)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUaB-1hjhk8FE_XZ87vPPSfHqb6OcM0cF) from [Alex the Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/@AlexTheAnalyst) - this is a Youtube playlist with over 50 videos. He walks you through the basics of SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, Python, and more. Along with projects and a way to create a portfolio website for free. **Highly recommended** if you have a limited budget and want to get started learning right away.
- [Google Data Analytics Course](https://grow.google/dataanalytics/#?modal_active=none) - overview of what data analysis is and what a data analyst does along with introducing important skills needed for a data analyst like Excel, SQL, Tableau and R (check out [my review of the course](https://www.kellyjadams.com/post/google-data-analytics-course-review)). In short it's good as an introduction but it won't get you job ready alone.
- [Data with Danny Serious SQL Course](https://www.datawithdanny.com/courses/serious-sql) - focuses on case studies to provide real world practice, it takes a while to set up the IDE but worth it for the case studies. 
- [The Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/) - walks you through Python you learn the basics to more complicated ideas like object oriented programming. It also has assessments and mini-projects to complete to test your knowledge which I found the most useful.
- [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/) - learn how to use common Python libraries used in data analytics/science like NumPy and Pandas. I'm still going through this program but have learned from this instructor before and would recommend him.
- [The Complete SQL Bootcamp: Go from Zero to Hero](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-sql-bootcamp/) - learn PostgreSQL to perform data analysis. The setup takes a bit but once you do it you can analyze a dataset using SQL. It includes real world problems and a database.
- ChatGPT for Data Analytics (https://youtu.be/uhyMqbZI6rM?feature=shared) - learn how to automate tasks and save time with [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) (course by [Luke Barousse](https://www.lukebarousse.com/)).
- [SQL for Data Analytics - Learn SQL in 4 Hours](https://youtu.be/7mz73uXD9DA?feature=shared) - Learn how to write SQL and at the end build a project for your portfolio. Note: I did help create this course with [Luke Barousse](https://www.lukebarousse.com/a/2147831693/NY7yabZz). If youâ€™re interested in funding more courses there is an optional paid portion which gives you bonus materials. For the paid extras: check out [this link](https://www.lukebarousse.com/a/2147831688/NY7yabZz). All of three of these links here are affiliate links.
